Hello, I'm Roman Golovin

This repository isn't much yet. It contains my study projects.
I'm currently learning Data Science.
I haven't upgraded or modified older of them to match the new skills I've gained, yet.
If such changes are made, then the old and new versions of the project solution will be available.
You can contact me through the Telegram: t.me/goromaju


- to do: translate projects to English
- current learning focus: functions, classes, pipelines, pickle, pep8
